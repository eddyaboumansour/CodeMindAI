## TODO
iOS Bundling failed 65510ms node_modules\expo\AppEntry.js (889 modules)
The package at "node_modules\dotenv\lib\main.js" attempted to import the Node standard library module "path".
It failed because the native React runtime does not include the Node standard library.
To fix this, install the `path` package in your project.
